        <hr>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
        <ul>
            <b>SHRIMP FAJITAS</b>

            <li>2 tablespoons of honey</li>
            <br></br>
            <b>FOR ASSEMBLY (optional)</b>
            <br></br>
            <li>cilantro lime rice</li>
            <li>sour cream</li>
            <li>avocado</li>
            <li>lime wedge</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
        <ol>
            <b>PREPARE THE SHRIMP</b>
            <br></br>
            <li>
                Peel, devein, and remove the tails from the shrimp. Pat dry with
                paper towels to help with searing later.
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <b>MAKE THE SAUCE</b>
            <br></br>
            <li>
                In a bowl, combine olive oil, adobo paste, garlic, chili powder, 
                coriander, paprika, oregano, onion powder, cumin, salt, 
                and honey. Set aside for later
            </li>
            <br></br>
            <b>COOK THE FAJITAS</b>
            <br></br>
            <li>
                Heat a small amount of olive oil in each individual skillet over
                medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a portion of sliced bell peppers and onions to each skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Saute for about 5-6 minutes until
                they are softened and charred around the edges, about 75%
                cooked.
            </li>
            <li>Push the veggies to the side of each skillet.</li>
            <br></br>
            <b>SEAR THE SHRIMP</b>
            <br></br>
            <li>
                Add the shrimp to the empty side of each skillet. Let them 
                sear undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until they turn pink and
                develope a light crust.
            </li>
            <li>Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes until fully cooked.</li>
            <br></br>
            <b>COMBINE AND ADD SAUCE</b>
            <br></br>
            <li>
                Once the shrimp are cooked, toss them together with the 
                vegetables in each skillet. Drizzle a bit of the reserved 
                marinade over everything and stir to coat the shrimp and veggies
                in the flavorful sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a squeeze of fresh lime juice to each skillet and toss again
                to brighten the flavors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finish off each skillet with some optional add-ons like cilantro
                lime rice, avocado, sour cream, or even cheese!
            </li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h3 id="stovetop">STOVETOP METHOD</h3>
        <p>
            Start by heating a bit of olive oil in your skillet over medium-high
            heat. Once it's nice and hot, add the bell peppers and onions, 
            seasoning them lightly with salt and pepper. Sauté them until 
            they're softened and beginning to get those delicious charred edges,
            about 3/4 of the way cooked. Don't rush this part—the char is where 
            the flavor comes from! Once they're nearly done, push the veggies to
            one side of the skillet to make room for your shrimp.
            <br></br>
            Add the shrimp to the empty side of the skillet and let them sear 
            for 2-3 minutes on each side until they're golden and cooked 
            through. Shrimp cook quickly, so keep an eye on them to make sure 
            they don't overcook. Once the shrimp are done, toss them together 
            with the veggies and drizzle a little bit of the marinade over 
            everything. Give it a final toss and let everything sizzle for 
            another minute so the flavors can really blend. Finish with a 
            squeeze of fresh lime juice for that tangy kick. 
            <br></br>
            <h3 id="oven">OVEN METHOD</h3>
            If you're looking to use the oven, this recipe works beautifully 
            with just a few adjustments. Preheat your oven to 400°F. On a baking
            sheet, toss your bell peppers, onions, and shrimp with the 
            marinade, making sure everything is coated well. Spread the veggies
            and shrimp in a single layer, and cover the sheet with foil to 
            help everything soften and cook evenly. Roast for about 15-20 
            minutes, checking halfway through to toss everything. Once the 
            shrimp are pink and the veggies are tender, remove the foil and 
            let it cook for another 5 minutes to get some nice color on the 
            edges.
            <br></br>
            Covering the fajitas with foil while they cook helps soften the
            veggies and keep the shrimp juicy, but uncovering them at the end 
            gives everything that perfect roasted finish. Once done, squeeze 
            fresh lime juice over everything and give it a quick toss before 
            serving.
