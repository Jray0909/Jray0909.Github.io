            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <b>PREPARE APPLE FILLING:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a medium pan, melt the butter over medium heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the cubed apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of 
                    salt. Cook until the apples soften, about 5-7 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the vanilla extract, lemon juice, cornstarch, and 
                    water. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens, 
                    about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from heat and let the apple mixture cool.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <b>PREPARE CHEESE FILLING:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a bowl, mix the softened cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk, 
                    and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <b>ASSEMBLE DANISHES:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Roll out the puff pastry sheets on a floured surface and 
                    cut each sheet into circles using a large cookie cutter or 
                    a glass.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using a smaller cutter, lightly score a smaller circle 
                    about 3/4 of the way through the dough in the center of 
                    each larger circle. This will help keep the center from 
                    rising too much during baking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese filling into 
                    the center of each scored circle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Top the cream cheese mixture with a spoonful of the cooled 
                    apple filling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whisk the egg and milk together in a small bowl. Brush the 
                    outer edges of the pastry with the egg wash.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle a little granulated sugar over the edges.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <b>BAKE THE DANISHES:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake the danishes for 15-20 minutes or until the puff pastry
                    is golden and flaky.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <b>THE ICING:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla 
                    extract, and milk or cream until smooth. Adjust the 
                    consistency with more milk if necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the danishes are out of the oven and fully cooled, 
                    drizzle the icing over them and enjoy!
