                <h1>WELCOME TO FEASTING AT HOME</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, my name is <b><i>Sylvia Fountaine</i></b>, 
                    and I am a professional 
                    chef, former restaurant owner, and wedding caterer. 
                    I have been in the food industry for over 30 years!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>The Feasting at Home blog</i>
                    was launched in 2011 as a way to 
                    share my catering recipes, and since then, it has grown 
                    into a global food site with over 1,300 restaurant-quality 
                    recipes and millions of visitors each month! My friend 
                    Tonia Schemmel, chef and co-owner of our former restaurant, 
                    is back with me now, sharing her expertise and recipes 
                    as well! So when I say restaurant quality, I mean this 
                    literally! Most of the recipes came from our restaurant 
                    and catering business. It feels so good to work together 
                    again‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve been friends since the 10th grade!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope that through these recipes, you‚Äôll learn simple 
                    techniques to elevate your cooking and develop 
                    (or rekindle) a love of cooking! Because cooking your meals 
                    from scratch is the one thing you can do today to elevate 
                    your health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over half of our recipes are vegan or vegetarian, with many 
                    fish, chicken, and meat dishes, as well. Don‚Äôt worry, 
                    omnivores; we have something for you, too!

                    I realize food, like politics, can be very polarizing. 
                    My goal here is to highlight and celebrate what we have in 
                    common. Whether you are vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, 
                    paleo, keto, flexitarian or omnivore ‚Äì we can all agree on 
                    one thing: cooking meals from scratch using fresh, wholesome
                    ingredients is one of the most nourishing gifts we can give
                    ourselves and our families.

                    <h2>Food Philosophy</h2>
                    I try to eat organic, locally grown, whole foods that are 
                    high in nutrition. Even though I had a vegetarian restaurant
                    for 10 years and often eat plant-based during the week, as
                    a chef I want to taste and experience everything! I love 
                    fish and grew up eating lamb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overly processed foods are kept to a minimum, while quality 
                    and nutrition are paramount to me. If I am going to consume 
                    fish or seafood, I look for wild. I realize this is 
                    cost-prohibitive for many, but I rationalize this by only 
                    having it occasionally.

                    I don‚Äôt judge or label food groups as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad,‚Äù and 
                    I don‚Äôt believe that our diet needs to be black and white, 
                    political, or become a religion or an identity.
                </P>
                <p>
                    My best advice is to buy the highest quality ingredients 
                    (nutritious, organic, homegrown, or farmers market) you can 
                    afford, starting with what you eat the most. Then, as you 
                    use things up, trade them up for organic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Cook with the seasons</b>.
                    As a chef, what inspires me most is 
                    seasonal, local, organic produce. This is because local 
                    produce, grown in its true season, as close to us as 
                    possible, always has the best flavor and the highest 
                    nutrient density.  Cooking seasonally is a beautiful way 
                    to stay grounded in the seasons and the earth‚Äôs natural 
                    cycles. It is the one thing you can begin doing immediately 
                    that will elevate your cooking. No joke!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>There are many paths to health</b>. 
                    I will never try to convince
                    you to eat one way or another‚Ä¶ what you eat is your 
                    business! We are all so different genetically, and our 
                    bodies have different needs. My husband does better with a 
                    plant-rich, higher-protein diet,  but I do better with a 
                    lower-fat Mediterranean Diet. I do love sharing things I 
                    stumble upon, but there is never any pressure! I have no 
                    agenda here. I just want your food to taste good!  Haha!üòâ 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Many recipes are globally inspired</b>. I was raised in Los 
                    Angeles by immigrant partents: a Finnish mother and Egyptian
                    father, both right ‚Äúoff the boat.‚Äù We traveled extensively 
                    and they both loved to cook and entertain. They were also 
                    very frugal- every single thing was made from scratch, 
                    nothing was wasted, yet somehow they created the most 
                    amazing meals. They showed me how the humblest of 
                    ingredients could be turned into a feast, utilizing a wide 
                    array of vegetables and herbs and spices. When my husband 
                    Brian and I travel, it always revolves around food. 
                    We love experiencing different cultures and cuisines and 
                    learning local flavors and techniques.

                    <b>Cooking is Comforting</b>. 
                    YES, occasionally, we cook comfort 
                    food recipes that may not seem very ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù on the surface
                    because I‚Äôve found there are times in one‚Äôs life when 
                    ‚Äúcomfort food‚Äù is actually comforting, on a soul level. 
                    When my sweet old mom passed away several years ago, 
                    my dear friend Sonna brought over her Four-Cheese Macaroni 
                    and Cheese. It was the only thing that would go down after 
                    days of not eating. To this day, I believe that was the 
                    most healing, nurturing thing I could have put into my body
                    at that time ‚Äì and I‚Äôve never forgotten it.

                    <b>Adaptable Recipes</b>: 
                    With so many mixed households ‚Äì vegans and meat-eaters ‚Äì 
                    both living under the same roof,  cooking can get so 
                    complicated. So I‚Äôve started creating ‚Äúadaptable‚Äù recipes 
                    to help make cooking easier (one meal, two ways) and 
                    hopefully enjoyable again.  For more of these kinds of 
                    recipes ‚Äì visit our ‚ÄúAdaptable‚Äù category.

                    <b>Easy Healthy Dinners</b>: 
                    Most of you have shared how short on time you are. 
                    I get it. Most of the recipes here in the last few years 
                    are geared towards you! Time-saving, healthy recipes that 
                    can be on the table in 30 minutes or need very little 
                    hands-on time. I created a category just for you

                    <h2>Cooking is Nurturing</h2>
                    There are days like Sundays when some of us truly enjoy 
                    spending time in the kitchen while something slow roasts in 
                    the oven for hours ‚Äì and you‚Äôll find those recipes here too 
                    because they are nourishing on a soul level. Cooking, if we 
                    allow it, can center and ground us, and bring us back to 
                    ourselves. In this day and age, we need this. 

                    Back when I was catering big stressful weddings, on my days
                    off, even when I felt totally exhausted, I would often find 
                    myself back in my home kitchen simply making a pot of soup 
                    or baking a loaf of bread. Cooking can be incredibly 
                    restorative and healing when we allow ourselves the time to 
                    be present.

                    And for some, cooking is the one creative thing we get to 
                    do during the day. Soul-satisfying!  My hope is that you 
                    experience this incredible joy for yourself. I like to 
                    think what we put into our bodies becomes a part of us. 
                    Not just the food itself, but the energy we put into the 
                    food. Cooking can be such a loving act. A grounding place 
                    to be when the world feels as if it is crumbling around us.

                    This is why I share quotes on the blog, little nudges to go 
                    within and simply listen because the deepest truths can be 
                    found inside ourselves.  Cooking has become a gentle 
                    practice for me to still my thoughts, become present, and 
                    reconnect with the peace within. When I do this, not only 
                    does it help restore me, it inevitably affects those around 
                    me, without even saying a word. People, especially those 
                    who live with us, can feel our energy. This simple act 
                    affects those around us and carries into the rest of the 
                    evening.
